# Haskell: Pure Functional Programming in Practice

After exploring functional programming concepts and their JavaScript implementations, let's dive into Haskellâ€”a purely functional programming language that embodies these principles at its core.

## What Makes Haskell Special?

Haskell is unique because it enforces pure functional programming. Unlike JavaScript, which allows mixing paradigms, Haskell ensures:
- All functions are pure
- All data is immutable
- Side effects are explicitly managed through the type system

## Key Features

### 1. Strong Static Typing with Type Inference

Haskell's type system is both powerful and convenient:

\`\`\`haskell
-- Type inference
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

-- Custom types
data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }

-- Type classes
class Describable a where
    describe :: a -> String

instance Describable Person where
    describe (Person name age) = name ++ " is " ++ show age ++ " years old"
\`\`\`

### 2. Pattern Matching

Pattern matching makes code more expressive and safer:

\`\`\`haskell
data Shape = Circle Float | Rectangle Float Float

area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = pi * r * r
area (Rectangle w h) = w * h

-- Pattern matching in list comprehensions
head' :: [a] -> Maybe a
head' [] = Nothing
head' (x:_) = Just x
\`\`\`

### 3. Lazy Evaluation

Haskell only evaluates expressions when needed:

\`\`\`haskell
-- Infinite list definition
naturals = [1..]

-- Only first 5 elements are computed
firstFive = take 5 naturals  -- [1,2,3,4,5]

-- Efficient prime number generation
primes = sieve [2..]
  where sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve [x | x <- xs, x \`mod\` p /= 0]
\`\`\`

### 4. Monads and Effects

Haskell uses monads to handle side effects cleanly:

\`\`\`haskell
-- IO Monad for side effects
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "What's your name?"
    name <- getLine
    putStrLn $ "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"

-- Maybe Monad for optional values
findUser :: ID -> Maybe User
findUser id = do
    user <- lookupUser id
    profile <- lookupProfile id
    return $ User user profile

-- Either Monad for error handling
parseConfig :: String -> Either String Config
parseConfig str = do
    json <- parseJSON str
    config <- extractConfig json
    validateConfig config
\`\`\`

### 5. Type Classes and Polymorphism

Haskell's type classes provide powerful abstractions:

\`\`\`haskell
-- Functor type class
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Applicative type class
class Functor f => Applicative f where
    pure :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Monad type class
class Applicative m => Monad m where
    return :: a -> m a
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
\`\`\`

## Practical Examples

### 1. Working with Lists

\`\`\`haskell
-- List comprehension
squares = [x^2 | x <- [1..10], even x]

-- Higher-order functions
sumOfSquares = sum . map (^2) . filter even $ [1..10]

-- Folding
product' = foldr (*) 1
sum' = foldl (+) 0
\`\`\`

### 2. Custom Data Structures

\`\`\`haskell
-- Binary Tree
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

-- Tree traversal
inorder :: Tree a -> [a]
inorder Empty = []
inorder (Node x left right) = inorder left ++ [x] ++ inorder right

-- Tree manipulation
insert :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insert x Empty = Node x Empty Empty
insert x (Node y left right)
    | x < y     = Node y (insert x left) right
    | otherwise = Node y left (insert x right)
\`\`\`

### 3. Real-world Application

\`\`\`haskell
-- Web API response handling
data ApiResponse a = Success a | Error String

handleResponse :: ApiResponse User -> IO ()
handleResponse (Success user) = do
    putStrLn $ "User found: " ++ userName user
    saveToDatabase user
handleResponse (Error msg) = 
    putStrLn $ "Error: " ++ msg

-- Concurrent programming
import Control.Concurrent

processUsers :: [User] -> IO [Result]
processUsers users = do
    mvar <- newEmptyMVar
    mapM_ (forkIO . processUser mvar) users
    mapM (\_ -> takeMVar mvar) users
\`\`\`

## Benefits of Haskell

1. **Correctness**: Strong type system catches errors at compile time
2. **Maintainability**: Pure functions are easier to test and reason about
3. **Performance**: Lazy evaluation and optimizations provide efficient execution
4. **Concurrency**: Pure functions make parallel programming safer
5. **Abstraction**: Advanced type system enables powerful abstractions

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Learning Curve**: Different paradigm requires new way of thinking
2. **Ecosystem**: Smaller compared to mainstream languages
3. **Industry Adoption**: More common in academia than industry
4. **Performance Predictability**: Lazy evaluation can make it harder to reason about performance

## When to Use Haskell

Haskell excels in:
- Compiler design
- Parse transformations
- Mathematical computations
- Concurrent applications
- Domain-specific language development

## Key Takeaways

1. Haskell enforces pure functional programming
2. Strong type system provides safety and expressiveness
3. Lazy evaluation enables elegant solutions
4. Monads cleanly handle side effects
5. Pattern matching and type classes enable powerful abstractions

Whether you use Haskell in production or not, learning it will significantly improve your understanding of functional programming concepts and make you a better programmer in any language.
